#### Summary of Symptoms
During your appointment, you reported experiencing stomach issues for the past few months. Here’s a summary of the main symptoms you described:

- **Bloating:** You have been feeling increasingly bloated after almost every meal.
- **Sharp Abdominal Pain:** You experience sharp pains in your abdomen, particularly after larger meals. This discomfort occurs frequently, about four to five times a week. The pain typically lasts for one to two hours but has recently been lingering longer, sometimes affecting your comfort for the entire evening.
- **Nausea:** You sometimes feel nauseous, especially when the pain intensifies, although you haven't experienced any vomiting.
- **Bowel Movements:** Your bowel movements remain mostly normal; however, you noted an increase in frequency, going about twice a day instead of your usual once.
- **Appetite Changes:** Your appetite has been slightly affected, leading you to avoid eating at times due to fear of bloating afterward.
- **Heartburn:** You mentioned occasional burning sensations in your chest, which you described as mild and not frequent.

#### Family Medical History
You shared that your mother had some issues with acid reflux in her younger years, but there is no significant history of gastrointestinal problems within your family.

#### Physical Examination Findings
Upon examining your abdomen, I noted tenderness in the upper middle region and slightly on the left side, although the discomfort was not severe.

#### Proposed Diagnostic Tests
To further investigate the cause of your discomfort, I recommended the following tests:

1. **Abdominal Ultrasound:** This is a non-invasive procedure that uses a handheld device to create images of your organs, particularly focusing on your gallbladder, liver, and pancreas. This test aims to identify any possible issues such as gallbladder problems that might be contributing to your bloating and discomfort.

2. **Blood Tests:** These will help us check for signs of infection, inflammation, liver function, and vitamin levels.

**Schedule:** We can arrange the ultrasound within the next few days, and blood test results typically come back within a couple of days. The ultrasound results should be ready 48 hours after the test.

#### Management Recommendations
While we await your test results, I have provided several recommendations to help manage your symptoms:

- **Dietary Adjustments:** 
  - Avoid high-fat and spicy foods as these can worsen bloating.
  - Limit caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated drinks, which may also contribute to your discomfort.
  - Try to eat smaller, more frequent meals rather than three larger ones to reduce pressure on your stomach.

- **Medications:**
  - Consider using over-the-counter antacids such as **omeprazole** or **famotidine** (one dose before meals) for the next couple of weeks to reduce stomach acid and possibly help with bloating and pain.
  - Keep an eye out for any side effects from these medications, including headaches, nausea, or constipation. If you experience any unusual symptoms, let me know so we can adjust your treatment plan.

- **Stress Management:** Since stress can exacerbate gastrointestinal symptoms, I recommend incorporating stress-reduction techniques such as **meditation**, **yoga**, or **deep breathing exercises** into your daily routine to help improve your overall well-being.

#### Next Steps
- We will contact you as soon as we have the results from your ultrasound and blood tests, and we will discuss the next steps based on what we find.
- If necessary, we may consider further diagnostic options, such as an endoscopy, to explore your stomach and esophagus in more detail.

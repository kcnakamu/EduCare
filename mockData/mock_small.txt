it’s been about two weeks since the headaches started they’re not constant but when they do happen it feels like pressure right behind my eyes sometimes it’s worse in the mornings especially after waking up I’ve also been feeling really tired even after sleeping eight hours I wake up and I’m still exhausted

okay have you noticed any changes in your vision when the headaches happen any blurry vision or difficulty focusing no not really sometimes my eyes feel a little strained but nothing that’s lasted more than a few minutes

how’s your sleep been any trouble falling asleep or staying asleep yeah I’ve been having trouble falling asleep lately takes me a few hours sometimes and I end up waking up a lot during the night when I do sleep it’s not restful

any nausea vomiting sensitivity to light or sound when you get these headaches no vomiting but light and sound can be irritating when it gets bad I try to stay in a dark room until it passes

got it I’m going to take a look at your blood pressure first just to make sure there’s nothing going on there okay so your blood pressure is 140 over 90 a little elevated but we’ll keep an eye on that do you have a family history of high blood pressure or migraines my mom has migraines but no one in my family has high blood pressure

thanks for sharing that I’m also going to suggest we run some blood tests today to check for things like anemia and thyroid function sometimes fatigue and headaches can be linked to those I’ll also recommend a follow-up appointment for a head MRI if these headaches persist that’ll give us a better picture if anything neurological is going on does that sound good yeah sounds good

for now I think it’s important we address your sleep issues first lack of good sleep can definitely contribute to the fatigue and even to headaches I’m going to prescribe 10 milligrams of melatonin to help you fall asleep easier it’s natural and should help regulate your sleep cycle take it 30 minutes before bed for the next two weeks if it doesn’t improve we can discuss other options also make sure to limit screen time an hour before bed and try to stick to a consistent bedtime routine

thanks that sounds like something I can try I’ve been using my phone right before bed and I didn’t think it could be affecting me like that

it definitely could also keep an eye on your caffeine intake try not to have any after 2 p.m. since that could be interfering with your sleep too

okay I’ll keep that in mind

if the blood tests come back normal and your sleep doesn’t improve we might explore other options like sleep studies or referral to a sleep specialist but let’s start with the melatonin and see how it goes

how about the headaches should I take anything for them when they happen I’ll recommend ibuprofen 400 milligrams as needed for the headaches but not more than once every six hours if the pain becomes unbearable or you notice new symptoms like changes in your vision or difficulty speaking definitely let me know right away

will do thanks

we’ll follow up with the blood test results in a few days and I’ll contact you if anything stands out otherwise we’ll schedule another appointment in two weeks to reassess how you’re feeling and check on your sleep how does that sound sounds good I appreciate it

great take care and I hope the changes we’re making start to help
